# Welcome to InfoRutas Frontend

The InfoRutas Frontend is developed in React with a simple and well organized structure.

Every reusable component lives in the components folder. Styles for these components are in the styles subfolder. Each component has a css file.

The different pages or routes live in the pages folder. Again, there's a styles subfolder for page specific styles.

The global Css styles can be found in the file global.css.

The global design of the web site is managed using the Layout component (in the components folder). There you'll see that we use other components such as the Navbar.

We communicate with the backend using axios. As for now, there's no global setting for the backend endpoints.
